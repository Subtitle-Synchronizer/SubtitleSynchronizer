1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
- Captain, what's this town called?
- Puerto Miguel.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
- Is it alive?
- It's asleep.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When the sun falls people
will get up. They call it a siesta.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do we have to siesta here
for 4 weeks?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
4, 5, 6...

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
- Take that long to fix an engine?
- Not me. The engineer.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I didn't make the steamboat,
I just operate one.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
- Captain, wait!
- Every mother's son...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
...is picking up gold by the fistful
in California...

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
...and I'm marooned in a Mexican
village called Pu...

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
- What did he call it?
- Puerto Miguel.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Puerto Miguel.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
- But what can we do about it?
- Nothing.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
- They must have some alcohol.
- I think so.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There we are.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a funny thing.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I know everybody on board except you.
I don't know anything about you.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
- Your called Hooker and that's it.
- That's it.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That kid thinks he knows you
from Texas, but he can't remember.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then it couldn't have been much.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And even if it was,
it wouldn't be any of my business.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't see how.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Being a professional gambler,
I like to know the people I meet...

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
...because I might play them sometime.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's what makes me so inquisitive.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
- That's natural.
- I'm also a kind of poet...

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
...and all kinds of people
interest me.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
- That makes sense.
- I see what I can get out of them,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
...either their money or their
character, or both.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You've heard of &quot;getting blood
out of a stone&quot;, haven't you?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm getting out of you.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Two drinks.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Two drinks.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is the way my luck's running.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can speak two languages,

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
...but I'm in a country
that isn't one of them.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I found that pretty women
speak the same language everywhere.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
- What about the ugly ones?
- I never listened.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not as bad as I thought it'd be.
It's worse.

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Somebody once said:
&quot;Believe nothing a woman says,

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
...but believe everything she sings&quot;.

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
- Who said that?
- Me.

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's the trouble with him?

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What's he saying?

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He disliked the way that man
was looking at his girl.

46
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You see we want to be peaceful
and friendly.

47
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We may be here
for quite a while.

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can handle myself.

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
- I'm sure of it.
- You think not?

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
- He just said &quot;he was sure of it&quot;.
- Relax, Daly.

51
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It may not be as bad as you think.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We can fish in the mornings,
get drunk in the afternoons...

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
...and we can play cards at night.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
- You might even get lucky.
- Like catching lighting in a bottle.

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Fiske, you know what you can do
with a deck of cards?

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can tell my fortune.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Anything you like.

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The Red Queen.
That means that...

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you know.

60
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
- What's she saying?
- She's got a mine.

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Her husband is trapped in a cave-in.
She wants help to get him out.

62
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
- She'll pay 1,000 dollars a man.
- There ain't a man at the bar.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Did you hear what I said?
Did you understand?

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He just told us.

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I offered them a thousand a piece.

66
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll double it for any of you
if you'll help.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A man is lying out there hurt,
maybe dying. An American.

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
- If that isn't enough...
- The price is right.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- But, why is it so high?
- Is a man's life too high a price?

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I didn't put the price on it,
you did.

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know what to do
or what to say.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
- I've got to get help or he'll die.
- Lady, won't you sit down?

73
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why will none of them go
even for so much money?

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
None of them will go out there.
They're afraid of the Indians.

75
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you?
You don't look afraid.

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ma'am, the thing I'm afraid off
still hasn't been found.

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He says only fools go up there.
He must be one.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's going with her.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
- You said 2,000 dollars?
- You've got it in your hand.

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
- All right, I'll go.
- 2,000 for each of the rest of you.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You?

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Madam, I can live anywhere
in the world for 6 weeks,

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
...but alone in this town.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Meet me in an hour
at the blacksmith's shop.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'd like for one of you
to come with me now.

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You.

87
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
- Are we lost?
- No.

88
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We pass the face of that cliff.
